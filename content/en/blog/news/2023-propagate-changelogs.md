## Background

A standard part of the Jenkins X pipelines since a long time is the execution of `jx changelog` that takes the
commit messages between the release currently being created and the previous one and creates a change log from these.
The change log is then stored as a release note in GitHub or other git provider.

This is all very well, but this changelog has not been very informative with regard to upgrades, ie those applied with
`jx promote` or `jx updatebot`. One example of this is [the release notes of jx](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases)
after the split out of most functionality to plugins. But lately these have improved due to some new functionality
that I will outline here.

# Example

## jx
But first a couple of examples of what this functionality achieves by looking closer to one release of jx.

https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/tag/????

Here you first see the changelog of jx itself generated from commit messages https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-docs/commits/main?after=135acfa58877feedb2131ca1ae872dd0226bf34e+34&branch=main&qualified_name=refs%2Fheads%2Fmain

Then there is a separator and then comes the changelog of jx-????. If you look in the commit messages referred to above
you will see a link to the pull request on jx for this upgrade: https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/pull/????. As you can
see this pull request includes the changelog for version xxxx of jx-???? as generated by `jx changelog`.
